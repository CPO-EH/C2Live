# C2Live: Tracking C2 Malicious IPs Over Time


C2Live is an open-source project aimed at providing a comprehensive and interactive platform for tracking Command and Control (C2) malicious IP addresses over time. This project focuses on categorizing and visualizing these IPs based on the framework they are associated with and the country they originate from. The goal is to help security professionals, researchers, and organizations gain insights into the evolving landscape of cyber threats. This project is based on [C2Tracker](https://github.com/montysecurity/C2-Tracker) from [@_montysecurity](https://twitter.com/_montysecurity).
